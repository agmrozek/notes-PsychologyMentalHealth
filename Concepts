Cognitive defusion, also known as deliteralization, is a technique used in Acceptance 
and Commitment Therapy to help people cope with uncomfortable or unhelpful thoughts 
and feelings. It is a useful technique for people with depression and anxiety, as 
uncomfortable and unhelpful thoughts and feelings are often a part of their experience. 
Cognitive defusion involves creating space between ourselves and our thoughts and feelings 
so that they have less of a hold over us.
