Cognitive defusion, also known as deliteralization, is a technique used in Acceptance 
and Commitment Therapy to help people cope with uncomfortable or unhelpful thoughts 
and feelings. It is a useful technique for people with depression and anxiety, as 
uncomfortable and unhelpful thoughts and feelings are often a part of their experience. 
Cognitive defusion involves creating space between ourselves and our thoughts and feelings 
so that they have less of a hold over us. 

Cognitive defusion helps us to realize how our thoughts are affecting us. Mental health 
issues often make us feel as if we don’t have a choice in what we think or feel. 
They can even make us believe we will think and feel negatively for our entire lives. 

We are so used to accepting our thoughts and feelings as true without taking the time to 
consider they may not be. When dealing with anxiety and depression, we need to remember 
that our thoughts have a negative bias and that we can’t accept them as one hundred percent 
true one hundred percent of the time. 

We need to create space and try to see our thoughts for what they are and how they make us feel. 
It’s a challenging process, but that awareness can help us diminish the impact our thoughts 
have on our mental health.
